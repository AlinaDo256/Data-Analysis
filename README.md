## Business Problem
Regal Retail lacked the data-driven insights needed to optimize profitability across its global operations. The company struggled to identify which products, markets, and customer segments were most valuable, how discounting affected margins, and where inefficiencies existed in its supply chain. Without clear visibility into these performance metrics, management couldn't make informed decisions to improve sales strategies and operational efficiency.
## Business Relevant Questions
* Which product categories and sub-categories drive the highest profit margins?
* How do discount strategies impact profitability across different segments?
* What are the key logistics inefficiencies affecting delivery performance?
* Which customer segments deliver the highest profit efficiency?
* How do shipping modes align with order priorities across regions?
## Process
The analysis followed a structured approach using Excel and Power BI to transform raw transactional data into actionable business intelligence. The methodology included data preparation, exploratory analysis, visualization development, and strategic recommendation formulation.
## Data Cleaning and Preparation
* Structure validation and standardization of fields
* Missing value detection and handling with standardized placeholders
* Date and numeric formatting standardization
* Column splitting for enhanced analytical granularity
* Text cleaning using TRIM() and PROPER() functions
* Duplicate transaction identification and removal
* Inconsistency correction in categorical fields
## Key Insights
### Sales Analysis
* Technology products, particularly Copiers and Phones, generated the highest profits ($200,000-$250,000), while Tables showed consistent negative profitability.
* High discount rates (30% for Tables) inversely correlated with profitability across categories.
* The Consumer segment demonstrated superior revenue generation despite higher discount rates.
* Total sales showed consistent growth from 2011-2014, especially after 2013, but profit margins did not follow the same upward trajectory.
* Paper achieved the highest margin (25%) with minimal discounting, demonstrating efficient revenue generation.
* Countries like the United Kingdom and India achieved strong profit outcomes relative to their total sales compared to the United States.

### Logistics Performance
* Critical-priority orders paradoxically experienced the highest shipping costs ($65) and longest delivery times (6.8 days).
* Medium-priority orders achieved optimal balance between delivery time (3.5 days) and cost ($30).
* Delivery performance showed significant geographic variations, with Southeast Asia and Central America experiencing the longest delays.
* Seasonal fluctuations in shipping efficiency were identified, with March, June, and September showing consistent delivery time spikes.
* Of 13,000 Medium-priority orders, 10,000 were shipped via Standard Class (the slowest option), revealing inefficient shipping mode selection.
* Bulky items like Tables and Bookcases incurred significantly higher shipping costs and longer delivery times than smaller items like Binders and Paper.

## Reconmendations
### Based on Sales Analysis

* Implement selective discounting strategies targeting high-margin products while reducing discounts for underperforming categories like Tables.
* Prioritize improvement of the Furniture category's profitability through reassessment of product mix and pricing optimization.
* Develop targeted promotions for the Consumer segment, which has proven to generate higher sales and profits even with discount incentives.
* Replicate successful strategies from high-performing regions like the UK and India across other markets to enhance global profit efficiency.
* Create exclusive loyalty programs for consistent customers rather than offering blanket discounts across all customer segments.

### Based on Logistics Operations Analysis
* Develop tiered logistics handling strategies grouped by product dimensions and weight to enhance shipping efficiency for bulky items.
* Establish approval thresholds for expedited shipping on non-critical orders to control unnecessary premium shipping costs.
* Realign shipping mode selection with order priority, ensuring Critical and High-priority orders utilize appropriate expedited services.
* Implement regional distribution centers in areas experiencing consistent delivery delays to improve fulfillment performance.
* Adjust staffing and inventory levels to address seasonal fluctuations in March, June, and September when delivery times consistently peak.
* Negotiate carrier-specific freight terms for high-cost product categories to improve delivery efficiency without compromising service quality.
